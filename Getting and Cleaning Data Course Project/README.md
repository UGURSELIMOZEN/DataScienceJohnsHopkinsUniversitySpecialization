### Introduction

This README.md file explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.

### Goal of the Course Project
1. A tidy data set is expected at the end of the project as outcome
2. A link to a Github repository with R script for performing the given data analysis
3. A code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md. You should also include a          README.md in the repo with your scripts. This repo explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.
4. Analysis run_analysis.R script

### Project Progressing Steps

1.Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.

2.Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.

3.Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

4.Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.

5.From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
